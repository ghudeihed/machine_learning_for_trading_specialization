Hi, I'm Evan, a Tech Lead
on the Cloud Training team. In this course, we'll be
talking about TensorFlow. We'll first start with
an introduction to the framework and preview
its main components, as well as the overall
API hierarchy. Tensorflow 2.x was launched
with tight integration of Keras with eager
execution by default, and Pythonic function execution among many other features
and improvements. By the way, when I say it's 2.x, it means everything
that you learn here is for the second major
release of TensorFlow, that's the 2, and for any
minor releases, that's the x. At the time this was recorded, the latest stable
release was 2.2. But you very well maybe on a future minor release version, the principals in
syntax that you'll learn will still apply. Next, we'll discuss
how to train on large data sets using
the data set API. Then how to use feature columns
to prepare the data for training and how
activation functions are needed in order for
the model to be able to learn from nonlinearities
in the data. Then we'll introduce
the tf.keras API. tf.keras is TensorFlow's
high-level API for building and training deep neural network
learning models. We'll explore the sequential
and functional APIs and then learn how to use them to create deep learning models. Finally, we'll
discuss how to deploy models serving up
these inferences at scale using the Cloud AI platform managed service.
Let's get started.

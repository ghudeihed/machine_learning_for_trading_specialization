In this module, we'll talk about activation functions
and how they're needed to allow deep
neural networks to capture nonlinearities of your data. Then, we'll learn
how the sequential and the functional APIs of Keras allow us to simply
write neural network models, and how it can deploy
those models to cloud AI platform to serve them
in a scaled fashion. Lastly, we'll discuss one
of my favorite topics, which is how you can avoid overfitting your
models by applying regularization techniques
during model training. Let's jump right into it.

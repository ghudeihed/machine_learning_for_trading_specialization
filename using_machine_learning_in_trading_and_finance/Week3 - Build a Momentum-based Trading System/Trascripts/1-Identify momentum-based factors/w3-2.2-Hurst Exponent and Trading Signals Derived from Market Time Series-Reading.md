If you would like to explore the Hurst coefficient as a trading signal, please have a look at [Hurst Exponent and Trading Signals Derived from Market Time Series](https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2018/66670/66670.pdf)
by Petr Kroha and Miroslav Skoula (2018). They give a good survey of the theory behind Hurst and also create a “Moving Hurst” trading signal that they test against an MACD signal on NASDAQ and DAX data. They conclude that Moving Hurst is a better trade signal than MACD, but that it fails to make a profit when trading costs are factored in.

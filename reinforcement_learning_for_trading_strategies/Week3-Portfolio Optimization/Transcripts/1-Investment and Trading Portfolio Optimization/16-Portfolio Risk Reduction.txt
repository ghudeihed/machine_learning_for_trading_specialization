In this notebook, we'll
explore what Ray Dalio, referred to as the Holy
Grail of Investing. How by increasing
diversification, you are able to reduce
your overall risk as measured by the standard
deviation of portfolio returns. The idea here is to show that if you can
create a basket of uncorrelated or low
correlation return streams, you can reduce your
portfolio risk significantly by
increasing the number of streams in your portfolio. The first step is to
increase the resolution of your plotter to retain level and import the
required libraries. In order to get the same
results as will be shown, set the random seed to 42. Next, you create a
function that simulates n return streams with a given
mean and standard deviation, which you name risk, and a given average correlation, which you name corr or
C-O-R-R, between them. Ideally, you will have
real data and be able to generate real return streams for the assets in your portfolio. We are using simulated
returns streams here to generalize this example. Just to make sure, let's do a
sanity check by calculating the means and standard deviations
of the returns streams. This is the simplest way to
construct such a portfolio. You create an array of
pairwise correlations between assets that are equal
to a given level of corr. The important point
is that the average of all pairwise
correlations should be equal to corr or 0.6,
in this example. Then you'll create a helper
function to calculate the pooled risk given a number of return streams
in the portfolio. Next, you'll build your
simulated data set. You'll analyze your
return streams with risks levels in the range
of 1 percent to 14 percent, for very number of streams
ranging from 1-20. You'll plot the risk levels for different average correlations
ranging from 0-0.7. You can already see
in this array where the first line
represents the risk for a one asset portfolio for correlations ranging from 0-0.7, how the portfolio risk decreases
as you add more assets. You can also see how the decline in the
risk is much sharper, when there is a low correlation
between the assets. For example, going
from one asset to 10 assets with a
correlation of zero, reduces your risk from 14.14
percent to 4.44 percent. With a correlation of 0.7, the reduction in
risk is only from 14.12 percent to 12.1 percent. Next, you create a function
that produces a plot given your simulated data and a chosen risk level
of 10 percent. Your plot shows how
diversification benefits to portfolios with assets that have a risk level of 10 percent. More highly correlated
portfolios do not benefit as much from
increased diversification. You get only small
reduction by adding highly correlated assets beyond
a total of three or four. In contrast, you can
have the risk by adding just six or
seven uncorrelated, or more realistically, weakly correlated assets to a portfolio. The benefits of
diversification are reduced risk through exposure to different sources
of trading revenue. The insight that
Dalio brings is that the construction of a
diversified portfolio, through a combination of
uncorrelated return streams, significantly reduces
your overall risk raising in turn your return
to risk or sharp ratio. By the careful mixing
of uncorrelated assets, you can capture this
true low-risk Alpha. This gives you the
ability to add leverage and greatly increase
your potential returns. This is the strategy that
Dalio and Bridgewater have used successfully in
their risk parody approach, which is described
in the link shown.

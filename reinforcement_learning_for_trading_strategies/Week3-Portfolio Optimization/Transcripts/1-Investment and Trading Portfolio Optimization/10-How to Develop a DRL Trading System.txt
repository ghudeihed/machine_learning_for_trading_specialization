Now that you have a better understanding
of the different types of reinforcement learning methods, we'll discuss the practical steps
required to create an RL trading system. By the end of this session, you will be
able to identify the components of an RL trading system, understand the steps
required to develop a deep RL strategy. And identify the strategy checks
needed before going live with your RL trading system. To begin, we'll talk about the main
components of an RL trading system. An RL trading system is very similar
to other quantitative systems. Once it has been successfully trained
in back tested on historical data, it is ready to be paper traded and
potentially go live. The RL trader whose command center is the
RL algorithm, receives data on the current market sand acts on it by either
placing trading order or doing nothing. If it creates an order,
it may be executed immediately or it may need approval
from a human operator. For most trading strategies,
especially high frequency trading, intervention by a human operator would
not be feasible or necessarily desirable. Due to the need to react quickly
to changing market conditions. The new market state along with order
performance data is passed to the policy optimization algorithm. And then the revised policy along
with new market data are analyzed, tested and passed to the RL trader which
then makes a new trading decision.

In this section, we
will shift our focus to managing risk from an investment
and trading perspective. By the end of this session, you will be able to
distinguish between risk management techniques
for a trading portfolio, as opposed to an
investment portfolio. You will also understand
how to achieve the benefits of
diversification in a trading portfolio and be able to identify potential criteria for optimizing risk management at the strategy and
portfolio levels. To begin, we'll talk about risk management in an
investment portfolio. Investment and trading portfolios have the same overall objective, maximizing risk adjusted return. Investment managers
accomplish this by identifying undervalued
assets based on fundamentals or other criteria and combining them
into a portfolio. Systematic risk affects the value of all assets but to
different degrees, which we will discuss later. For now, think of
systematic risk is coming from macro factors
such as GDP growth, employment, interest
rates, or credit spreads. Systematic risk is often measured by the volatility of
the overall market. In an absolute sense, the market should include
all investable assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities,
and cryptos. As a practical matter, it is usually represented
by Beta or by the VIX, which is the volatility
of the S&P 500 index. Idiosyncratic or
unsystematic risk affects a single assets, such as the stock of
a particular company. The impact of quarterly
earnings announcements, especially surprises,
is a good example. We will measure risk by the volatility of
an asset's price. You can reduce idiosyncratic risk by diversifying your portfolio. You can achieve diversification
on many levels, including across asset classes, geographic regions,
and industry sectors. Two main ways to diversify
a portfolio or to hold them perfectly correlated assets and to increase the number
of assets held. The risk of a portfolio is measured by the ratio
of the covariance of a portfolio's return to the variance of
the market return. This is portfolio Beta. A portfolio of US
stocks that is fully diversified would
have a Beta of one. When a portfolio is diversified, the risk of the portfolio or its variance is reduced to
the level of systematic risk, the risk of the market itself. You can see that a high
level of diversification can be achieved with
as few as 10 assets. The total risk of any
portfolio is composed of systematic risk and
unsystematic risk. Increasing the number
of securities in a portfolio reduces the
unsystematic risk component, leaving the systematic
risk components unchanged. You can see how the addition of geographically diversified
stocks allows you to achieve a higher reduction in risk than a portfolio composed
solely of domestic stocks. Next, you will see
that the level of additional diversification
that is possible by including international
stocks depends on which geographical region
the stocks come from. The table shows the correlation between different
asset categories. You can see that the
correlation between US large cap equities and
equities from EAFE or Europe, Africa, and the Far East
and emerging markets, EME are still fairly high. This could be due to the
fact that global markets were in a long uptrend
during the period these correlations were
measured between 2009 and 2019. To get maximum diversification, you really need to add other asset classes
to your portfolio, such as currencies
or fixed income, which have a negative correlation with US large cap stocks. One thing to keep in mind when you are diversifying
geographically, is that you will be
exposed to FX risk when you convert your foreign
returns into your own currency. As we saw in the previous
correlation matrix, exposure to FX risk can also
be a good way to diversify. Most of the funds managed
by portfolio managers are constrained to invest in
a single asset category. This means investors must
diversify their portfolios by investing in several funds focused on different
asset classes.

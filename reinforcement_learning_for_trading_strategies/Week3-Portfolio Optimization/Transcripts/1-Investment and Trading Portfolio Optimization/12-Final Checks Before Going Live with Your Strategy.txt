Now you are ready to make
the final checks before allowing your RL trader
to trade a live market. You spent a lot of time and experimented with
different RL models. You've managed to achieve
a good sharp ratio for your RL trader after
lots of trial and error. How do you know if your RL
trader is ready to go live? What are the indications of
a well-trained RL trader? Don't be in a hurry. It's going to take you a while to create a profitable
algorithm trader, and you'll never know if it works until you test it
with real money. In a medium size trading firm, it takes about a
$100,000 to $250,000 to develop and test
several strategies until you get one that works out. But then the return can be 10 to 30 times the
development costs depending on how long you're able to keep your trading edge. Next are a few of the
key criteria that must be satisfied before you can
even think of deploying. First, your RL Trader
seems to perform well over a long historical period and under different
market conditions. This shows the trader
has versatility and can be profitable under
a variety of conditions. Second, your trader
also performs well with another security that
you haven't trained it on at the same time
series timestep. This is a very positive signal. Timesteps are the number of
lagged observations that you use to predict your next
value in a time series. Third, your algorithm gets
decent performance in the test set and has done well in the training
and development sets. If your algo makes big
losses in the test set, it means that it has been
over-fitted and that you need to either
bring in more data, and/or look for a less deep
neural network architecture or you need to increase
your dropout percentage. Recall that dropout
is a technique where randomly selected neurons
are ignored during training. They are dropped out randomly. This means that their
contribution to the activation of downstream
neurons is temporarily removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron
on the backward pass. With a higher dropout percentage, it is less likely that your algo has been over-fitted
to the training data. As your neural network learns, neuron weights settle into their context within the network. Weights of neurons are tuned for specific features providing
for some specialization. Neighboring neurons come to
rely on this specialization, which if taken too
far can result in a fragile model that is to specialized to
the training data. This reliance on context
for a neuron during training is referred to as
complex co-adaptations. You can imagine that if
neurons are randomly dropped out of the
network during training, that other neurons will
have to step in and handle the representations
required to make predictions for the
missing neurons. This results in multiple independent internal
representations being learned by the network. The effect of this is
that the network becomes less sensitive to specific
weights of the neurons. This in turn results in a
network that is capable of better generalization and is less likely to over
fit the training data. Your algorithm performs very badly in the training set
and cannot be trained. You should use more inputs
for your neural network, or increase the depth
of your neural network, or adjust the hyper parameters of the neural network
and RL Agent. Also make sure that you have
initialized the weights for the deep learning part before
starting the training. Your algorithm performs
well in all train and test sets and you are
ready to try live trading, but you need to keep on training despite having smaller
learning rates for your deep neural network. This incremental learning, despite happening
at a lower rate, will allow you to squeeze
some more dollars of performance out of your
algo before live trading. You need to scale the
implementation of your algo to reflect
market conditions. You should not deploy immediately into a
live environment with super high margins and
extremely volatile conditions. Instead, you start with a
demo account and trade in demo for a while to
see what happens. Alternatively, you
can trade live, but use Microtrace to
gain some confidence, and see where you might
need to intervene.

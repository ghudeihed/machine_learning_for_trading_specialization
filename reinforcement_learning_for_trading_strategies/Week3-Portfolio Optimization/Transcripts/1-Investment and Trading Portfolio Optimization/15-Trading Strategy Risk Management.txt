Next, we'll talk about
risk management in an algorithmic or automated
trading strategy portfolio. DRL strategies and other
algorithmic trading systems are designed to run with minimal or no human operator intervention. This means that the
most important part of the design and implementation of these systems is the capital and risk
management strategy. In most firms, risk
management is divided into strategy level decisions and
portfolio level guidelines. We talked before about using different types of stop-losses
in a trading strategy. Stop-losses put a limit on the downside risk you have
in a trader strategy. They can be static, which means your
downside risk is fixed. They can also be dynamic or
variable where you reduce your downside risk by tightening your stop-loss when a trade
is made in unrealized profit. Recall that tightening a
stop-loss means moving the stop-loss price closer
to the current market price. This reduces your potential
loss from the trade. We also talked about using
different metrics to predict the profitability
of a trade or strategy. These included
win-loss percentage and average win and loss. These metrics are your
estimate of what percent of your trades will be profited
out versus stopped out, and what will be the average gain or loss on these trades. You should design
the reward system of your RL algorithm so
that it will optimize the stop-loss levels and profit targets to maximize
your return on a strategy. One metric that the RL algo must optimize is the average
trade completion time. If the profit targets
are too big or the stop-loss levels
are set too far above or below the
trade entry price, which would increase the
downside risk of each trade, then it may take too long for the trade to profit
out or stop out. The maximum time to
complete may be mandated by a day trading only policy
or other considerations. Trade completion time
is also constrained by the opportunity cost of tying up trading capital for
long periods of time, which leads to fewer
trades being made in a lower annualized return
on trading capital. The RL reward design must take these factors
into consideration. A global stop-loss can
be used in addition to or instead of a stop-loss
set for each trade. It is a general stop-loss set for all trades opened on any of the strategies currently
in use regardless of the number of open trades or
the direction of the trades. When the aggregate P&L of
all open trades reaches a specified negative
amount which is usually a percentage of the
trading capital ranging from one
percent to 10 percent, the global stop-loss level is
touched and all trades are closed out or hedged to
protect against large losses. Using a global stop-loss is a key factor in ensuring the
survival of a trading firm. The second way you
can manage risk is by strategy diversification. You can reduce risk
by implementing multiple strategies spread across different asset classes. You can also reduce risk by using the same strategy on different
assets within each class. If you trade pairs of assets, you can diversify
your risk by using a variety of methods
to choose pairs, such as principal
components analysis, fundamentals or momentum. You can also trade
multiple pairs within each asset class and trade
multiple asset classes. The objective here is to have trading revenue streams from a number of different and
uncorrelated sources. Next, we'll talk about
optimizing risk management by combining uncorrelated
revenue streams in a trading portfolio. A trading asset is
a combination of a particular strategy applied to an asset to generate
a revenue stream. The amount of risk
reduction from holding a portfolio of trading
assets will depend on the level of correlation
between trading assets and also the number of unique trading assets that
are held in the portfolio. This is similar to the
diversification benefit that an investment portfolio
manager obtains by holding several assets in
multiple asset classes, such as holding a
diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

Now, we'll describe
AutoML Vision. This is a Cloud Auto ML
product for image data. Cloud AutoML Vision specializes in training models for
image classification. You can load the CSV file
and the image files from Cloud storage or you can upload them from your local
computer using import. Training supports
several file formats including JPEG and PNG. The images can be up to
30 megabytes in size. They have to be converted
to base 64 encoding, which stores the
image as a text file. The prepared file will be a txt file or a
compressed zip file. Service request only
recognize JPEG, PNG, and GIF files up
to 1.5 megabytes. The trained model will
work best when there are at most 100 times more images for the most common label than
for the least common label. Consequently, for
model performance, it is recommended that you remove very low-frequency labels. You can label the images in the web UI or in some
cases you can use the human labeling service
offered by Google if you have more than
100 unlabeled images. To gauge your trained
model's readiness, AutoML Vision creates
the confusion matrix for up to 10 labels. If you have more than 10 labels, the matrix includes the 10 labels with the most
incorrect predictions. The quality of vision
custom models has a lot to do with the
choice of training data. Train on images with similar properties to those
you intend to classify, for example, images of
similar resolution, lighting, focus, and
level of detail. High confusion, low
average precision scores or low precision
and recall scores can indicate that
your model needs additional training data or
has inconsistent labels. Perfect is the enemy of good. Perfect or very high
average precision scores could indicate that something
is wrong in the model. The data is too easy
and not varied enough, it could mean that
the model might not work well beyond the test data. In this case, increase the variety of images in
the prepared data set.

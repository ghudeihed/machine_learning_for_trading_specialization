Hello, and welcome to the reinforcement learning for
trading strategies course. My name is Ram Seshadri, and I'm a Machine Learning
Consultant at Google. I'm Jack Farmer, the lead instructor with the New
York Institute of Finance, providing training
to professionals in the financial services and related industries in New
York and around the world. In this course, we focus on reinforcement learning
and how it can be used to approve the efficiency and performance of your
trading strategies. Deep learning and
reinforcement learning have become very popular in the past decade because
we're able to take full advantage of the scale of data that's available today. The application of deep
reinforcement learning for trading still remains
largely unexplored. However, the promise that this learning
strategy as shown in other fields has attracted researchers' interests
and focused efforts towards the exploration of deep reinforcement
learning for trading. It's still early, but
chances are good that quantitative trading will be disrupted by deep
reinforcement learning. In the first module, we introduced some of the history behind reinforcement learning. We also go into the
technical aspects of reinforcement learning before neural networks
became commonplace. In the second module, we dive into
reinforcement learning that leverages neural networks. Also, we cover LSTMs. LSTMs are a type of
deep learning that have proven really effective in
modeling sequential data. They are very applicable
to developing trading strategies because as
you've seen in this course, trading data is
usually sequential. In the final module
of this course, we discuss how to
develop and optimize a reinforcement learning-based
trading portfolio. We'll talk about the basics of investment and trading
risk management. Also we'll introduce the
Google Cloud Service AutoML, a powerful machine learning tool that can be used to train high-performing models for trading portfolio optimization
with zero coding. Machine learning is a
cutting-edge field of research with breakthroughs coming
in at a fast pace. Methods that are taught today may become outdated tomorrow. Therefore, it's important
you keep your eyes and ears open for new advancements
in the field. We will provide you with references to further your
own knowledge in each module. Welcome to the exciting world of machine learning and
trading. So let's dig in.
